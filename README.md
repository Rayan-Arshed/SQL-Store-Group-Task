# SQL-Store-Group-Task
## Overview
A group task completed on my training program, the goal of which was to experiment with SQL and practice my skills in it by completing a few preset tasks.

## Project Goals
The goals for this task were fairly simple, to use a database and to add, remove, and query data from it, by completing the tasks by performing the correct functions or queries.

## Tools and Technologies Used
### MySQL Workbench
- SELECT statements
- UPDATE and DELETE
- GROUP BY
- AS aliases
- Calculations using columns

## Strong Points of my Work
We were able to complete all the tasks required in this worksheet, and as I was group leader, I was able to aid, assist, and guide my partners on the worksheet towards the solution, where we theorised ideas and tested them, before implementing them into our work if they worked. Particularly stand out is being able to do calculations with the columns, allowing for the Total Revenue to be calculated from the dataset.

## Repo Sections
